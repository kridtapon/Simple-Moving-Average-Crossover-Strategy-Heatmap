# Simple-Moving-Average-Crossover-Strategy-Heatmap

A backtest is performed using vectorbt, a backtesting library. This framework allows us to test different strategies by defining entry and exit signals based on the moving averages.
Entry Signal: A buy signal is generated when the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term moving average.
Exit Signal: A sell signal is generated when the short-term moving average crosses below the long-term moving average.
